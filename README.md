# Android Development Repository

## Description

This is a repository containing my journey and experiences through Android Development.
Since I started out as a Java developer, this repository also serves as a place for my practice of Kotlin programming langauge.

<br>
These projects and exercises were chosen from free materials on the internet, as well as some free tutorials and courses on the Internet.
<br>

This repository contains three types of work:<br>
1) Practicing the Kotlin programming language and learning it's features.<br>
2) Standalone projects for practice Android Development.<br>
